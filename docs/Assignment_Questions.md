# Bank Like X
## Problem
Many questions within the commercial lending space take the form “What is X for a bank like us?”  
For example:  
- “What is the average loan-to-value ratio on a typical owner-occupied real estate loan, for banks
like us?”
- “What is the average rate on a typical 5-year term, owner-occupied real estate loan, for banks
like us?”  

To answer these questions, we need to be able to identify a group of banks that are “like” a given
bank. We use a combination of our own data and publicly available data (such FDIC data found
[here](https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/PWS/DownloadBulkData.aspx)). We would like to see your solution to
this problem. We would like you to solve the “banks like this one” problem.

## Questions
1. Where would you start? What information do you wish you had? In the absence of perfect
knowledge and access to perfect data, what can you do to make a first attempt?

I would start by getting familiar with the data set. Understanding the dataset provides a lot of insight into the scope of the project. You can immediately get an idea of how much effort it will take to import can clean the data set. You can also being to formulate some ideas on how you will break it down into some sort of model allowing for easy interaction and analysis.

I wish I had more information and knowledge about many of the parameters in the data set. The data set referenced in the problem has a lot of detail about bank activities and standings. However, not being familiar with the banking industry means many of those parameters aren't meaningful to me personally. As a first pass and to create a reasonable scope for the project, I focused in a a few paremters from common sources such as the balance sheet and income statement. That way I was either more familiar with the parameters or I could easily look up their meaning.
